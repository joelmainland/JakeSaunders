# PyrfumeCodefest


## What is Pyrfume Codefest?

The goal of theCodefest is for you to apply your programming skills, learn from others, get feedback, explore others' work, and connect with the larger AChemS community. This codefest will focus on data curated by the Pyrfume Project. We will provide starter code, orient you to the available datasets, and, if you are in person at AChemS 2022, provide a team of teachers as support for working in both R and Python. We welcome coders of all skill levels and from any chemosensory system! 

This is inspired by the great project over at [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

## What is Pyrfume?

The Pyrfume Project (pyrfume.org) is curating a variety of odorant-related datasets from both industry and academic sources. The goal is to make it easy to download digitized datasets and organize them in a consistent way to make it easier to find and use existing data in combination with other datasets and tools.

## In person events at AChemS 2022

Orientation: Wednesday, April 20th at 4 pm (Driftwood): Learn about how to use pyrfume to access data. We will provide sample code and access to ~21 digitized olfactory datasets. The goal is to visualize the dataâ€“anything from reproducing a graph from the original publication to an interactive app.

Code with friends and the teaching staff on the back deck of the Hyatt, starting at 9pm. Please bring your own laptop if possible. We will have a limited number of laptops to loan out. Mountain Dew, regular and diet. No cosmic brownies. 

Show your work: Thursday, April 21st at 4 pm (Great Egret): Present your best result at the Mentoring and Networking Social, you have two minutes to present one graph.

## Guidelines 
(modified from [/#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:
1. This is NOT about criticizing the original dataset. Focus on the provided dataset, learning, and improving your visualization techniques.
2. This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #PyrfumeCodefest practitioners or their code! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other's posts and help promote the #PyrfumeCodefest community!
3. Use the hashtag #PyrfumeCodefest on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.
4. Include a picture of the visualization when you post to Twitter.
5. Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!
6. Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with something simple!
7. Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.
